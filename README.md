#python code to detect the face landmark fast

In this tutorial we will learn how to implement fast face landmark detection using Dlib pre-trained model in OpenCV using Python. The code 
is available in the Github repository.

In the above github repository you will get code only and the model of Dlib - 68 face features, you can download from the below link:

https://github.com/davisking/dlib-models/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2

Download the code and model in the same folder and then run the command as shown below

python fastFaceLandmarkDetection.py
